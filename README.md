# **Project Title: Rockfall Development**


**Rockfall is a 3D space-shooter game built in Unity where players control a spacecraft defending a space station from incoming asteroids. The ship flies forward automatically through space while the player steers it using on-screen joystick controls. Your mission is to destroy asteroids before they collide with the station. Each hit reduces the station’s health until it is destroyed, ending the game. Rockfall focuses on fast-paced arcade action with simplified, “fake-physics” flight mechanics — smooth movement and quick reactions rather than complex space simulation. It’s designed to demonstrate 3D gameplay, UI integration, and object management in Unity.**
